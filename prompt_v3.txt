Return a JSON array where the keys are food, care_management, transportation, housing, chronic_conditions. If the client has an unmet need, the key is True, otherwise simply mark it false. If the client has a chronic condition from the list return it as an element of an array for chronic conditions. If there are no chronic conditions detected, simply return an empty array for the key chronic_conditions.
